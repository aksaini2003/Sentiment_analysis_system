## Overview

SentimentAI is a sophisticated sentiment analysis tool that can determine whether a movie review is positive or negative. It uses machine learning models trained on the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset to provide accurate sentiment predictions with confidence scores.

## Features

- ðŸ§  Advanced sentiment analysis using machine learning
- ðŸ“Š Confidence score visualization
- ðŸ’« Modern, responsive UI with smooth animations
- âš¡ Real-time analysis with loading states
- ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful gradient design elements
- ðŸ“± Mobile-friendly interface

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing and Model Training

1. Dataset: IMDB Movie Reviews (50,000 reviews)
2. Data Preprocessing Steps:
   - Removed duplicates (418 duplicates found)
   - Encoded sentiments (positive: 1, negative: 0)
   - Text preprocessing (lowercase, special character removal)
   - Vectorization using TF-IDF

### Machine Learning Models

Two models were implemented and compared:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier

Both models were trained on the preprocessed IMDB dataset to classify reviews as positive or negative.
